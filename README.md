Sudoku Project explanation
The Sudoku project is a way for the user to solve Sudoku puzzles. By inputting in the known numbers and the blanks with -1, it will iterate through the numbers list and choose the fitting number to solve the block or it will return False if it is not solvable by the regular rules of Sudoku which cannot have a repeating number in a row, column, or block.
